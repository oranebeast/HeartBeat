HeartBeat
=========

An animated tray icon. Helps to see if your machine is frozen.

Why might this be useful?

If you have a crashy machine, Sometimes its heard to tell its frozen, Sometimes its just the mouse konking out,
Others its a full lock up. The system icon is an animated pulsing circle to help you tell.
